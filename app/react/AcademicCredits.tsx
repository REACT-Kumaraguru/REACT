        The REACT Fellowship is a deeply immersive, real-world learning program built to complement and expand traditional education. While it does not confer a formal degree or diploma, its design is aligned with national credit frameworks and global best practices in experiential learning—making it both academically meaningful and future-ready.

      <p style={{ fontSize: "1 rem", color: "black", marginBottom: "1rem" }}className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        The full REACT Fellowship is equivalent to <strong>18 REACT credits</strong>, each representing <strong>45 to 60 hours</strong> of field immersion, guided learning, reflection, and solution-building.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li><strong>3 credits</strong> – Field immersion and lived experience documentation</li>
        <li><strong>3 credits</strong> – Problem extraction, ideathon, and validation</li>
        <li><strong>12 credits</strong> – Project development, implementation, and evaluation</li>
      </ul>

      <p style={{ fontSize: "1 rem", color: "black", marginBottom: "1rem" }}className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Participants typically complete this journey in a span of 6 to 18 months. While the standard duration is 6 months, extensions of 3, 6, or 12 months are available based on project needs and performance reviews.

        REACT credits draw inspiration from the <strong>UGC’s Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)</strong> framework. They are designed to be cumulative, flexible, and centered on demonstrable learning outcomes. Though REACT does not award degrees, its structure supports academic integration where permitted.

        REACT is in active dialogue with universities and autonomous institutions to explore formal credit recognition. Where agreements are in place, REACT credits may be used for:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>Contributing to elective or interdisciplinary credits</li>
        <li>Supplementing portfolios for capstone or minor projects</li>
        <li>Fulfilling institutional criteria for applied learning experiences</li>
      </ul>

      <p style={{ fontSize: "1 rem", color: "black", marginBottom: "1rem" }}className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Even where formal transfer is not applicable, REACT credits serve as an academically structured, mentor-evaluated record of learning.

      <p style={{ fontSize: "1 rem", color: "black", marginBottom: "1rem" }}className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Every participant who completes the REACT Fellowship will receive:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
        <li>A detailed certificate with credits earned and performance grade</li>
        <li>Mentor-reviewed feedback and developmental report</li>
        <li>A validated portfolio of the problem solved and solution implemented</li>
      </ul>

      <p style={{ fontSize: "1 rem", color: "black", marginBottom: "1rem" }}className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        In an era where proof of practical problem-solving matters more than theory alone, REACT gives you not just recognition—but a record of readiness.
