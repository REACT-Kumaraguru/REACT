        🌿 Live the Life – 30 Days
      </h3>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        What if your classroom had no walls? What if your teacher was the land,
        the weather, the people — and every choice they make to survive and
        thrive? That’s what <strong>Live the Life</strong> is all about.
      </p>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        For 30 days, you don’t just visit a community — you become a part of it.
        Whether it’s waking up at 4:30 AM to milk the cows, bargaining in the
        market, repairing broken irrigation pipes, or listening to stories over
        firewood dinners — you <em>live the everyday</em>. And in doing so, you
        start seeing what most people miss: the friction points, the workarounds,
        the invisible systems at play.
      </p>

        There are seasons in a life where you don’t study the world — you enter
        it. You sleep under its breath, walk through its silence, and work with
        its weight. Not to master it. But to understand what it asks of you.
      </blockquote>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        REACT is that season. Not a course. Not a curriculum. A crossing.
      </p>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        Here, you live among the questions — not answer them. You let mud stain
        your palms and conversations shape your mind. You observe systems not in
        diagrams, but in the pace of a morning, the choice of a tool, the curve
        of a shared path.
      </p>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        It is not light. And yet, it is. Because what burdens the mind lightens
        the self when carried with purpose.
      </p>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>This is where learning stops rehearsing — and begins to live.</p>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        This isn’t a field visit. This is full immersion. You aren’t a tourist —
        you’re a temporary citizen. And that changes everything.
      </p>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        You document your observations — not as a researcher, but as someone who
        belongs. You journal, film, photograph, sketch, talk, and most
        importantly — <strong>listen</strong>. This phase isn’t about fixing
        anything yet. It’s about noticing everything.
      </p>

      <p style={{ textAlign: "center", fontStyle: "italic", color: "#4f46e5", margin: "2rem 0" }}>
        “We can’t change a world we haven’t walked in. So we walk in it. Fully.”
      </p>

      <p style={{ color: "#000", backgroundColor: "#fff" }}>
        <strong>Explore</strong> is your entry into a life you’ve never lived —
        and possibly, never truly understood. It’s raw. It’s real. And it opens
        your eyes like no lecture ever could.
