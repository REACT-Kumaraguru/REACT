        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic text-indigo-700 font-medium mb-4">
          “Forests don’t speak human. But they leave signs. It’s our responsibility to listen—and to build the tools that listen better.”

        <p className="mb-4">
          In a world where forests fall silently and disappear without notice, the need to protect them is no longer just for conservationists. It now calls for technologists, designers, engineers, and system thinkers. <strong>Tech for Forest</strong> is built on a bold belief: nature and technology are not opposites—they are allies.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Across the globe, forests are being defended using satellites, AI, drones, and data. In India—with over <strong>70 million hectares of forest land</strong>—the need for such interventions is critical. Yet, on the ground, most forest officers work with outdated tools and overwhelming terrain.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Not a Tourist, but a Collaborator</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This theme invites you into the heart of India’s forest ecosystems—not as tourists, but as collaborators. You’ll work with forest officials, tribal cooperatives, and on-ground teams to understand what the forest truly needs from technology.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
          <li>Co-create with frontline forest workers to identify real needs</li>
          <li>Build tools to improve patrolling, reporting, and resource tracking</li>
          <li>Prototype drone mapping systems, forest fire alert tech, and wildlife monitoring solutions</li>
          <li>Respect and learn from tribal knowledge systems and integrate them into design</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why This Matters</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">
          This isn’t just about protecting trees—it’s about shaping the future of our planet. Forests are:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Climate regulators</strong>: India’s largest carbon sinks</li>
          <li><strong>Biodiversity havens</strong>: Home to rare and endangered species</li>
          <li><strong>Living classrooms</strong>: Teaching uncertainty, interdependence, and systems thinking</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Designing for Complexity</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You’ll gain firsthand experience of how ecosystems function—and how technology can be designed for complexity, not just efficiency. You won’t just build. You’ll listen, adapt, and iterate with the ecosystem itself.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 italic text-indigo-700 font-medium mb-4">
          “If the next generation of engineers aren’t fluent in ecology—we’re building for a world that might not exist.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          <strong>Tech for Forest</strong> is not about digitizing nature. It’s about understanding it—so that those who protect it can do so with strength, support, and speed.
