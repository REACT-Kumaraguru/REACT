          “Healthcare innovation doesn’t start in hospitals. It begins where care is delivered under pressure—with patience, not privilege.”

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the quiet, crowded corridors of India’s rural clinics and semi-urban Primary Health Centres (PHCs), healthcare happens under pressure. With minimal resources, limited digital access, and tireless staff, these centers handle everything from maternal care to minor surgeries—often serving hundreds with just a few hands.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Primary Health Innovation</strong> is your entry point into this world—not to intervene from above, but to walk alongside. You’ll witness how frontline healthcare workers juggle paperwork, referrals, and emergencies. And you’ll ask: How can we make these systems more connected, humane, and resilient?
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Support Before Disruption</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You’re not here to build over them—you’re here to build with them. You’ll study real-world medical delivery in resource-limited settings, with permission and humility. You'll work with ANMs, nurses, doctors, and clerks, and explore how tools—not tech buzzwords—can improve care.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Why This Matters</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Public Health</strong>: Strong PHCs mean earlier detection, faster recovery, and long-term community wellness</li>
          <li><strong>Equity</strong>: Rural healthcare deserves design rigour equal to that of urban hospitals</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Solutions built here can scale across the national public health infrastructure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Empathy in Execution</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This theme is not about grand solutions. It’s about quiet, persistent improvements. Where even a single screen or sheet can reduce hours of stress. Where your designs must function without internet, withstand erratic electricity, and respect the human at the center.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Primary Health Innovation</strong> is where care meets code, systems meet humanity, and design meets responsibility. If you want to build solutions that survive beyond the prototype—and matter to the people who use them—start here.
