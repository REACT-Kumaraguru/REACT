      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Technology doesn’t change the world on its own—people do. <strong>Tech for Society</strong> is where you stop building things no one asked for and start building what people actually need. It’s where engineering meets empathy, and coding meets context.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        India has no shortage of tech talent. But our biggest social challenges—access to education, equitable healthcare, public data, clean energy, justice, and inclusion—remain underserved. This theme challenges you to flip the script: not “what can I build?”, but <em>“what should I build, for whom, and how?”</em>
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 italic font-medium text-indigo-700">
        “When you use technology to reduce human struggle—not just increase convenience—you begin to build differently.”
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        You’ll work with community organizations, social workers, public sector units, or NGOs—who face real constraints every day. You’ll observe, collect stories, map journeys, and co-design tools that solve problems at scale <em>without overcomplicating them</em>.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <li>Map user pain points in public-facing services like health, education, or entitlements</li>
        <li>Build low-bandwidth, multilingual, mobile-first solutions for grassroots usability</li>
        <li>Design for dignity—creating tools that are not just functional, but empowering</li>
        <li>Prototype digital public goods or social innovations with real user feedback</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Why this matters:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Scalable equity</strong>: Tech built for society can multiply access, not just features</li>
        <li><strong>Responsible engineering</strong>: Understanding real users makes better developers and better humans</li>
        <li><strong>Global relevance</strong>: Low-cost, high-impact models from India are being adapted worldwide</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        This theme is ideal for coders, designers, system thinkers, or data enthusiasts who want to work where <strong>technology is not the goal—but the enabler.</strong> You’ll learn to build prototypes that can survive not just tech reviews, but field conditions.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 italic font-medium text-indigo-700">
        “Code is not neutral. Every system you build reflects what you value. Make it count.”
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        <strong>Tech for Society</strong> is where you stop chasing the next version—and start coding for the next human need. It’s not about scale alone. It’s about relevance, ethics, and impact.
